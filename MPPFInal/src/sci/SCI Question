Lambda expressions are an implemention of the declarative style fo programming. As a programmer no longer tells the compiler 
how he wants things done, rather he expresses to the compiler what he wants done. This is like Maharishi's analogy when 
he explained that a King only orders a banquet to be created, he neither creates it himself or participates in it's creation.
Likewise, in functional programming, a programmer focuses on what he wants done, and it is achieved effortlessly by the
compiler.
This is similar to egtting in touch with the unified field through transcendental mediation and as a result, every problem 
is solved effortlessly and things start to happen that enhance the individual because he is living according to the natural 
law.
